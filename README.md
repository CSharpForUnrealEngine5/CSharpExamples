[ThirdPerson](https://github.com/CSharpForUnrealEngine5/CSharpExamples/tree/main/ThirdPerson) - 
A simple example that shows how to assign input to character actions, as well as set up a simple
third person camera.  It is based on the Unreal Engine's Third Person template.

[FirstPerson](https://github.com/CSharpForUnrealEngine5/CSharpExamples/tree/main/FirstPerson) -
A more complex example that uses a first person camera.  It shows how to pick up and fire a wepon,
as well as adding sound and a recoil animation.  It is based on Unreal Engine's First Person template.

[ThirdPerson](https://github.com/CSharpForUnrealEngine5/CSharpExamples/tree/main/TopDown) -
This example generates a top-down camera, as well as how to use AI to navigate to a point on the map.  
The point is selected by clicking on the map.  It is based on Unreal Engine's Top Down template.
